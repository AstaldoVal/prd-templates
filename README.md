# PRD Templates Collection

A curated collection of **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** templates from product leaders, tools, and frameworks. Use with AI assistants, in your product workflow, or as reference when structuring requirements.

Each folder is a source (person, company, or method). Templates are in `.txt` or `.md` for readability and version control.
